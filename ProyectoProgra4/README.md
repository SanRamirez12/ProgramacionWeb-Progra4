## Applied Knowledge and Technologies

This project applies core concepts from the **Programming IV / Web Programming** course through the development of a full-stack web management system.

The following knowledge areas and technologies were implemented:

- **Web Application Development:**  
  Design and implementation of a dynamic web system using **ASP.NET MVC**, following the Model–View–Controller architectural pattern.

- **Backend Development (C#):**  
  Implementation of business logic using **C#**, including session handling, authentication, and role-based access.

- **Database Integration:**  
  Use of **Entity Framework** for object–relational mapping (ORM) and interaction with a **SQL Server** database.

- **Relational Database Design:**  
  Normalized database schema ensuring data consistency, integrity, and scalability across all system modules.

- **CRUD Operations:**  
  Full create, read, update, and delete functionality for clients, packages, and billing entities.

- **Session Management and Security:**  
  User authentication with session timeout control and login activity auditing.

- **Business Logic Implementation:**  
  Automatic tracking code generation, invoice creation, and tax and fee calculations.

- **Data Analysis and Reporting:**  
  Generation of monthly and client-based reports using filtered queries.

This project demonstrates the integration of backend development, database management, and web application architecture within an academic context.
